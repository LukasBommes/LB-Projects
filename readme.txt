++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Setting up the theme +++++++++++++++++++++++++++

1. Usage of Templates

	This theme provides various template files for specific content. For example 
	a static homepage with an image slider and featured content, an email contact 
	form, an archive page and a guest book. Moreover a template for fullwidth 
	content is being offered. Using this template disables the sidebar on the 
	specific site and stretches the content to full width.

	For setting up a site template go to "Pages" -> "Add New" in the WordPress 
	backend. Enter a title and content (optional) and select one of the five 
	templates in the "Template"-selector in the box "Page Attributes". If the 
	attribute box is not being displayed, go to "Screen Options" in the upper 
	right corner and make sure, that the checkbox for the attribute box is checked. 
	Publish the page and add a link to your navigation to make the page accessible 
	for your visitors.


2. Setting up the header navigation

	By default all your pages will be displayed in the header navigation. To create 
	a custom menu go to "Appereance" -> "Menus" Enter a name for the menu and click 
	"Create Menu". Select the content that shuld be displayed in your navigation and 
	click "Save Menu". Now got to the selector "Theme Locations" on the left, select 
	the menu you created before and click "Save". Now your custom menu should be 
	displayed on the front end.


3. Using Widgets

	The Theme provides four widget areas, on in the sidebar and three in the website's 
	footer. Simply drag and drop the widget you want to show to the appropiate widget 
	area. You may also use one of the custom widgets to display a better tagcloud, 
	information about the author or recent posts.
	
4. Using custom Shortcuts

	The them offers a wide range of so calles shortcuts, that allow you to display 
	predefined context in your articles. For example you can put text into differently 
	colored boxes by writing [colorbox color="red"]...Text...[/colorbox] for a red box or 
	box [colorbox color="green"]...Text...[/colorbox] for a green box. You will find a 
	list and a description of all available shortsuts in this article on my homepage:
